Introduction
------------
This folder contains debian packaging files for Qt Components Beta installation.
Qt Components Beta is just a new debian packaging name for Qt Components allowing
installation of any version of Qt Components on an environment with an existing
installation of Qt Components. This is a requirement if the user wants to install
a custom version of Qt Components on a MeeGo device.

Build instructions
------------------
Replace the qt-components/debian folder with this folder, i.e.
run these in qt-components folder:

mv ./debian ./debian_original
cp -r ./debian_original/debian_qt-components-beta ./debian

Then build with running this from the qt-components folder:

dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -j3

If the build is successful then you should have a bunch of qt-components-beta*.deb
packages in the parent folder.

Installation on a MeeGo device
------------------------------
DISCLAIMER: although these instructions have been tested on several devices with
different base images this is still a somewhat dangerous operation. Use at own
risk. Really!

Also this procedure will ONLY work on R&D images!

1) Connect the device via USB to the host computer
2) On the host computer run

sudo /sbin/ifconfig usb0 192.168.2.14

(if you lose the usb connection just rerun this, all terminal connections
are restored without a need to reconnect)

3) Connect to

ssh root@192.168.2.15

and enter the password

4) On the host copy the debian packages to device with

scp *.deb root@192.168.2.15:/opt

5) Then disable aegis by calling on the device:

echo 0 > /etc/aegis/enable ; sync ; reboot; exit

and wait for the reboot to finish.

6) On the device run

export AEGIS_FIXED_ORIGIN=com.nokia.maemo

This allows user to install custom debian packages

7) On device inside the /opt directory install the packages with

dpkg -i --force-depends qt-components-beta_*.deb

(You only need to install the main qt components package)

8) Reboot the device

The device is now using qt-components-beta instead of the default qt components


Uninstallation
--------------
Turn on the device:

dpkg -r qt-components-beta

The default version of Qt Components is now used. A reboot is not required.

Implementation notes
--------------------
The Qt Components Beta debian package installs Qt Components to folder

/opt/qt-components-beta/usr/lib/qt4/imports

The default Qt Components is overriden by setting environment variable
QML_IMPORT_PATH=/opt/qt-components-beta/usr/lib/qt4/imports

in

/etc/profile.d/qt-components-beta.sh

This script is executed during device boot by

/etc/profile
